# Topic Ideas

  * Which models/patterns do you use most often currently?
    * Which do you like the best and why?
    * If you use more than one, what constitutes using one over the other?
    * What are their strengths?
    * Weaknesses?

  * Which ones have you tried in the past?
    * Why aren't you using them anymore?
    * Was there anything about them that you wish you had in the patterns you're using now?

  * Asynchronous vs Concurrent vs Parallel
    * [Concurrency vs Parallelism](http://concur.rspace.googlecode.com/hg/talk/concur.html#slide-5) - talk by Rob Pike (on Go's concurrency model)

  * Thread Safety 
    * Shared mutable state / atomicity / race conditions
    * Locking strategies
    * Dead locks
    * Starvation and Priority Inversion


## Models

  * GCD
  * NSOperationQueues
  * ReactiveX
  * Promises
  * Blocks/callbacks
  * Threads
  * Run Loops? - Not sure this really counts as a Concurrency Model
